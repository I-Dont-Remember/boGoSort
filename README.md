# boGoSort
I was interested in learning a compiled language that wasn't C, 
and Go caught my eye.  After reading through their FAQ to understand 
the design choices and why it was made, I was hooked.  To learn a litle
about the language to see if I like it I decided to write the simple
Bogo sort.  
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort)  
With this I can learn how the basic strucutures of all languages are syntactically
different, as well as trying out Go's concurrency and built in test suite.  
I also plan to write a Python version to test speed and code complexity against,
since that is what I have used most as of late.
